# Introduction


I have put a teeny little "genome", which is basically 60 Kb of non-repetitive and non-missing
DNA from Chinook salmon,
into the file `genome/tiny.fna`. It is a FASTA file.  I have some code below
that prepares that "genome" (indexes it) so that you can align sequences against it
with _bwa mem_.  I then have written some R functions to automate the process of
taking two sequences (interpreted as paired-end reads), mapping them to our tiny genome,
and then printing the relevant lines from the SAM file for your perusal.

We build up these tools so that you can quickly make up any two sequences you
want, map them to the genome, then observe the results such as mapping posiitons, flags,
CIGAR strings, etc.

Fun!

# Indexing the genome, and slurping it up

For fun, look at the first 10 lines of the FASTA file.
```{bash}
head genome/tiny.fna
```
This "genome" only has one scaffold in it.  This is atypical.  Most genomes are in many
different pieces.
Before we can map sequences against this silly, fake, tiny single-scaffold, genome with _bwa_
we must _index_ it with _bwa_.  That is super easy:
```{sh}
bwa index genome/tiny.fna
```

## Now, store the sequence in a string to be able to excerpt parts of it

In order to grab little pieces from known parts of that genome,
will will put it into an R object as a string:
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
gen_seq <- read_lines("genome/tiny.fna")[-1] %>%
  paste(collapse = "")
```

Now, if you want to get a 100 bp segment from (base-1 indexed) positions 2001 to 2100,
and another from 2401 to 2500,
you can do it like this:
```{r}
R1 <- str_sub(gen_seq, 2001, 2100)
R2 <- str_sub(gen_seq, 2401, 2500)
```

# A function to get SAM output from mapping pairs of sequences

Here we just write a function that:

1. takes two sequences, say R1 and R2 as input
1. writes those sequences into two fastq files
1. maps them as paired reads using _bwa mem_
1. spits out the resulting SAM file to stdout (and saves a copy to disk for View()-ing as well)

```{r}
#' map two reads with bwa mem and print the alignment lines
#' @param R1 sequence of read 1 of the pair
#' @param R2 sequence of read 2 of the pair.
map_two_reads <- function(R1, R2) {
  
  # make a "workspace" directory to do this in and ensure that it is clean
  dir.create("workspace", showWarnings = FALSE)
  dump <- file.remove(dir("workspace/", full.names = TRUE))
  
  # create two fastq files with the sequences in there.
  # given them super high quality scores
  # here is the first seq
  cat("@FAKESEQ/1", 
      R1, 
      "+", 
      paste(rep(c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"), length.out = nchar(R1)), collapse = ""), 
      sep = "\n", 
      file = "workspace/seq_R1.fq")
  
  # and here is the second
  cat("@FAKESEQ/2", 
      R2, 
      "+", 
      paste(rep(c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"), length.out = nchar(R2)), collapse = ""),
      sep = "\n", 
      file = "workspace/seq_R2.fq")
                
  # now map them with bwa mem and print the resulting SAM without the header
  system("cd workspace; bwa mem ../genome/tiny.fna seq_R1.fq seq_R2.fq 2> bwa.stderr | tee bwa.output")
}
```

We demonstrate the use of `map_two_reads` in a moment, but
before we do, recall from the lecture that one of the two reads in a read pair must be
the sequence off of
the reverse strand of the reference genome.  So to make a properly paired read we will
need to make one of R1 and R2 above its reverse complement.  Here is a quick function to
do that:
```{r}
# Pass this function a DNA string and it will return its reverse complement:
revcomp <- function(R, not_reverse = FALSE) {
  cmp <- c(A = "T", C = "G", G = "C", T = "A")  # vector of bases named as their complements
  if (!not_reverse)
    paste(rev(cmp[strsplit(R, "")[[1]]]), collapse = "")
  else 
    paste(cmp[strsplit(R, "")[[1]]], collapse = "")
}
```

Now we are ready to map two reads.
Note that the output in the notebook will get wrapped in the output text box,
but that is OK. It is still reasonably easy to see the different columns and the different lines.
```{r}
map_two_reads(R1, revcomp(R2))
```

This shows two header lines (each starting with a `@`) and two alignment lines (one for each read).

If you want to view the alignments in tabular format with column names atop the 11
mandatory fields in a SAM file, here is a function to read the alignments out of
the last run of `bwa` (it merely read a file called `bwa.output` that is left in the
`workspace` directory) into a tibble.
```{r}
# working directory must be the project directory for this to work
slurp_last_alignment <- function() {
  aln <- read_tsv("workspace/bwa.output", col_names = FALSE, comment = "@")
  names(aln)[1:11] <- c(
    "QNAME",  # the name of the read (Q for Query)
    "FLAG",   # decimal value of SAM flag bitmask
    "RNAME",  # name of scaffold/chromosome the read aligns to
    "POS",    # position on reference scaffold/chromosome the read aligns to
    "MAPQ",   # mapping quality score, Phred scaled
    "CIGAR",  # CIGAR string
    "RNEXT",  # name of scaffold/chromosome the read's *mate* aligns to
    "PNEXT",  # position on reference scaffold/chromosome the read's mate aligns to
    "TLEN",   # inferred length of template from mapping position of read pairs
    "SEQ",    # the sequence of the read, **reverse complemented, if necessary** to match the forward strand
    "QUAL"    # read base quality scores (re-ordered if SEQ is reverse complemented)
  )
  aln
  
}
```
We use that like this:
```{r, message=FALSE}
slurp_last_alignment()
```

And, if you want to see it in the RStudio viewer window you could do:
```
slurp_last_alignment() %>% View()
```

OK! That is quick and easy.  Now we can play around with modifying sequences to let us see the
results on the mapping.


In that endeavor, let's just point out that if you want to know what the SAM flags mean, one
of the simplest ways of figuring that out is to use the Broad Institute's interactive
web site at
[https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html).


## Different scenarios

Let's play with some different things here.

### Wonky strand direction between mates

If each of those reads are on different strands what does that look like?
```{r}
map_two_reads(R1, R2)
```

Each segment maps by itself just fine, but check the SAM flags to see that they both
map to the forward strand.

### Indels  

Let's put the a 6-bp indel `AGAGAG` into read one between positions 10 and 11.
```{r}
R1
```

```{r}
R1_ind <- str_c(str_sub(R1, 1, 10), "AGAGAG", str_sub(R1, 11))                 
```

Map that:
```{r}
map_two_reads(R1_ind, revcomp(R2))
```

What if it is on the other strand?
```{r}
map_two_reads(revcomp(R1_ind), R2)
```
